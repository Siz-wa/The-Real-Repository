Project Progress – April 14 to May 3, 2025

Over the past few weeks, the development of the system has made some solid strides with both major and minor updates, bug fixes, and new features that have really helped improve the overall functionality.

April 14, 2025 – April 17, 2025
Things kicked off with some foundational work, including the 4th commit, which focused on getting some core features in place. By April 17, the “Forgot Password Mailer” system was introduced, giving users an easier way to recover their accounts, along with a secure method to handle tokens in the database.

April 19, 2025 – April 23, 2025
The system underwent some big changes here. The codebase was refactored to be more in line with the MVC architecture, making it cleaner and easier to maintain in the long run. Alongside this, several bugs were fixed, and the admin dashboard got a major boost with new analytics and graph features, providing better insights for admins to track system performance.

April 23, 2025 – April 28, 2025
The dashboard continued to improve with more detailed graphs, giving a more user-friendly way to interact with data. There was also a focus on demographic and city data features, making sure these were integrated and presented in a way that would be useful and intuitive for users.

April 28, 2025 – April 30, 2025
At the tail end of April, the database schema was updated to optimize data handling, which set the stage for smoother performance. Additionally, city data tables and graphs were added to the system, opening up the ability to dive deeper into geographic insights.

May 1, 2025 – May 2, 2025
May started off with a couple of important updates: payment and order details were tabulated for easier reading, and some work was done on improving the demographics sections, including gender and age data, with fresh graphing features to make everything clearer.

May 3, 2025
The latest commit focuses on employee account management, where a CRUD system was implemented for creating, updating, and deleting accounts. SMTP was also set up to send credentials automatically when an account is created, streamlining the onboarding process for new users.
